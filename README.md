## Model Providers

This template uses [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) Router API with the **GLM-4.5-Air** model for both regular chat and advanced reasoning capabilities.

### Features
- ✅ **Fast responses** - Optimized for speed
- ✅ **Chain-of-thought reasoning** - Detailed step-by-step thinking
- ✅ **Streaming support** - Real-time response generation
- ✅ **OpenAI-compatible API** - Easy integration

### Hugging Face Authentication

You need to provide a Hugging Face API token by setting the `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` environment variable:

1. Get your token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
2. Add to `.env.local`: `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here`

See [HUGGINGFACE_SETUP.md](./HUGGINGFACE_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.

With the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction), you can also switch to other providers like [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
